## 🌊 Twitch FlowSwitch

**Keep watching without interruptions.**
Twitch FlowSwitch automatically switches between the main and secondary video players during paid presentations — ensuring your stream keeps flowing smoothly.

### 🎯 What It Does

* Detects when Twitch triggers a “paid presentation” (ad break).
* Instantly switches to the backup (secondary) video feed.
* Restores the main player as soon as the presentation ends.
* Mutes and unmutes the correct player automatically.
* Displays a small overlay badge showing which player is active and the remaining countdown time.

You stay connected to your streamer — no black screens, no silent minutes, just continuous content.

### ⚙️ How It Works

FlowSwitch runs locally in your browser, seamlessly monitoring Twitch’s player state.
When an ad starts, it:

1. Mutes the main player.
2. Brings the secondary player into view.
3. Shows a countdown badge with the remaining presentation time.
4. Automatically restores the main feed afterward.

All processing happens on your machine. **No data is sent anywhere.**

### 🔒 Privacy

FlowSwitch **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data.
It only interacts with the Twitch player elements in your browser.
